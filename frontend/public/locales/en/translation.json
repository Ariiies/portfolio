    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "I am Luis Aries Meza Castillo, a passionate Computer Technology Engineer graduated from the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur in 2021. My professional journey is a combination of pragmatic software development and a deep exploration into the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence.",
    "p2": "I learned to program in 2017 with C++ and Java, but it wasn't until 2020 with Python that I found my passion for programming, creating software for analysis, machine learning, and computer vision. My career took off at Maestros Joyeros, where I took on the challenge of developing and maintaining a custom ERP system. Using Laravel and Livewire, I not only built new modules and refactored code to optimize performance but also automated crucial business processes. This experience gave me a solid foundation in full-stack development and taught me to create tech solutions that directly meet a company's operational needs.",
    "p3": "While I enjoy building robust web applications, I also have a strong passion for the potential of Artificial Intelligence. This curiosity has led me to develop complex personal projects, such as CorpusClassifier, an NLP model that classifies text documents with high accuracy using TF-IDF and neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.",
    "p4": "Additionally, I have delved into Computer Vision with projects like DetectFrameAI, a system that detects, classifies, and tracks objects in video sequences. This project allowed me to work extensively with libraries like OpenCV and neural network architectures like VGG16, from frame segmentation to object annotation.",
    "p5": "My approach to each challenge is based on logical and structured thinking, a quality validated by key certifications like PCAP (Certified Associate in Python Programming). Python is my main language, but my knowledge base is broad, including networking concepts endorsed by my CCNA certifications.",
    "p6": "Currently, I am focused on continuous learning. I am honing my skills in modern frontend with React, exploring data visualization with Power BI, and delving into DevOps practices with Docker. My goal is to combine these skills to build complete technological solutions that are not only functional and efficient, but also intelligent and capable of delivering real, measurable value.",
